# Configuration Readme

Some scripts in this project require a connection to the ecospatial PostgreSQL server for data retrieval. Connection details must be detailed in 'postgresqlcfg.R' in this directory with the following format:

```
user = "username"
pw = "password"
```

where username is replaced with your username, and password with your password.
