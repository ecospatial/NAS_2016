Barrier Island/Headland Restoration:
This restoration method restores wave-impacted areas using dune construction, with back-barrier marsh creation as a side effect. It is generally used when fragmentation or breaching occurs on barrier islands or mainland which meets the sea (headlands).

Freshwater Diversion:
This restoration method introduces fresh water, nutrients and sediments via diversionary structures and hydrological modification. It is used to reduce deterioration or subsidence of wetland areas with poor sediment and/or nutrient supply.

Hydrologic Restoration:
This restoration method modifies hydrology using sediment-derived levees and/or hard structures such as wiers, dams, or plugs. It is used to restore wetlands impacted by channelization and/or subsidence. This differs from freshwater diversion because it focuses both on freshwater input and saltwater intrusion.

Marsh Creation:
This restoration method creates marsh land by beneficial use of dredged materials, sometimes supplemented by vegetative planting. It is used to create wetland area where it previously was lost to one of many possible reasons. The expectation is that natural and/or modified hydrological regimes will supply the sediment, rather than wait for sedimentation processes to occur.
